document data,image data,includesMaterial,"In particular, large image datasets automatically scraped from the web may contain derogatory terms as categories and offensive images, and may also underrepresent specific classes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to carefully document datasets and curate their content."
document data,image data,includesMaterial,"Besides extensive simulations, real-world datasets such as Reuters document data and MNIST image data are also employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."
color information,invariant,usesOtherEntity,"With this illumination invariant vector and Lab color space, we propose an algorithm to generate a shadow-free image which well preserves the texture and color information of the original image."
color information,invariant,usesOtherEntity,"We investigate different representations for 3D anomaly detection and discover that handcrafted orientation-invariant representations are unreasonably effective on this task. We uncover a simple 3D-only method that outperforms all recent approaches while not using deep learning, external pretraining datasets, or color information."
digital game,learning process,usesMethod,"Educational gamification is not developed through a digital game but includes game elements for supporting the learning objectives. Learning through game creation is focused on the process of designing and creating a prototype of a game to support a learning process related to the game creation process or the knowledge mobilized through the game creation process."
