			<abs>  With the explosive growth of online information, recommender systems play a
key role to alleviate such information overload. Due to the important
application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works
in this field. In recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the
effective user/item representations from their interactions and side
information (if any). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) techniques have been
widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in
recommender systems essentially has graph structure and GNN has superiority in
graph representation learning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems.
Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of GNN-based recommendation models
according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks. Moreover,
we systematically analyze the challenges of applying GNN on different types of
data and discuss how existing works in this field address these challenges.
Furthermore, we state new perspectives pertaining to the development of this
field. We collect the representative papers along with their open-source

			<abs>  Information overload is a serious problem in modern society and many
solutions such as recommender system have been proposed to filter out

improve the recommendation performance (accuracy and diversity) of the
algorithms while overlooked the influence of topology of the online user-object
bipartite networks. In this paper, we find that some information provided by
the bipartite networks is not only redundant but also misleading. With such
"less can be more" feature, we design some algorithms to improve the
recommendation performance by eliminating some links from the original
networks. Moreover, we propose a hybrid method combining the time-aware and
topology-aware link removal algorithms to extract the backbone which contains

Traditional recommender systems, however, suffer from data sparsity and cold start problems. To address these issues, a great number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed to
leverage side information of users or items (e.g., social network and item
category), demonstrating a high degree of effectiveness in improving
recommendation performance. This Research Commentary aims to provide a
comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on recommender
systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview of
state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two
orthogonal perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of
recommendation: the memory-based methods, latent factor, representation
learning, and deep learning models. The others cover different representations
of side information, including structural data (flat, network, and hierarchical
features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data (text, image and video
features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new potential directions
in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey.

customers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user
preferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information
retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and
challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally
been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design
perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but
rather cast within an informal community of users and social context.
Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and
thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is
under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a
connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit
that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended
to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or
indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.
Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring
people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the
connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as
evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address.

			<abs>  Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem
in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users'
preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative
filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social
networks can also provide useful information to understand users' preference as
suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently,
deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which
facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information.
However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network
information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant
neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models
treat neighbors' information equally without considering the specific
recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information
relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models
do not explicitly capture the neighbor's opinions to items for social
recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep
Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social
relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive
experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework.

			<abs>  Recommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they
are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several
years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to
improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation
are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to
results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning
techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction,
trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different
information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are
adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of
categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building
explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system.
Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a
recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users
profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to
provide an explanation.

brought about by the Internet. Rigorous tests are needed to establish to what

we analyse a refined correlation-based collaborative filtering algorithm and
compare it with a novel spectral method for recommending. We test them on two
databases that bear different statistical properties (MovieLens and Jester)
without filtering out the less active users and ordering the opinions in time,
whenever possible. We find that, when the distribution of user-user
correlations is narrow, simple averages work nearly as well as advanced
methods. Recommender systems can, on the other hand, exploit a great deal of
additional information in systems where external influence is negligible and
peoples' tastes emerge entirely. These findings are validated by simulations

			<abs>  News recommender systems are used by online news providers to alleviate
information overload and to provide personalized content to users. However,
algorithmic news curation has been hypothesized to create filter bubbles and to
intensify users' selective exposure, potentially increasing their vulnerability
to polarized opinions and fake news. In this paper, we show how information on
news items' stance and sentiment can be utilized to analyze and quantify the
extent to which recommender systems suffer from biases. To that end, we have
annotated a German news corpus on the topic of migration using stance detection
and sentiment analysis. In an experimental evaluation with four different
recommender systems, our results show a slight tendency of all four models for
recommending articles with negative sentiments and stances against the topic of
refugees and migration. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between
the sentiment and stance bias of the text-based recommenders and the
preexisting user bias, which indicates that these systems amplify users'
opinions and decrease the diversity of recommended news. The knowledge-aware
model appears to be the least prone to such biases, at the cost of predictive
accuracy.

			<abs>  We introduce ZOOMER, a system deployed at Taobao, the largest e-commerce
platform in China, for training and serving GNN-based recommendations over
web-scale graphs. ZOOMER is designed for tackling two challenges presented by
the massive user data at Taobao: low training/serving efficiency due to the
huge scale of the graphs, and low recommendation quality due to the information
overload which distracts the recommendation model from specific user
intentions. ZOOMER achieves this by introducing a key concept, Region of
Interests (ROI) in GNNs for recommendations, i.e., a neighborhood region in the
graph with significant relevance to a strong user intention. ZOOMER narrows the
focus from the whole graph and "zooms in" on the more relevant ROIs, thereby
reducing the training/serving cost and mitigating the information overload at
the same time. With carefully designed mechanisms, ZOOMER identifies the
interest expressed by each recommendation request, constructs an ROI subgraph
by sampling with respect to the interest, and guides the GNN to reweigh
different parts of the ROI towards the interest by a multi-level attention
module. Deployed as a large-scale distributed system, ZOOMER supports graphs
with billions of nodes for training and thousands of requests per second for
serving. ZOOMER achieves up to 14x speedup when downsizing sampling scales with
comparable (even better) AUC performance than baseline methods. Besides, both
the offline evaluation and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of

system can improve the quality of various services by adding application data
generated by users on edge devices, such as visual and textual information, on
the basis of sparse rating data. The visual information in the movie trailer is
a significant part of the movie recommender system. However, due to the
complexity of visual information extraction, data sparsity cannot be remarkably
alleviated by merely using the rough visual features to improve the rating
prediction accuracy. Fortunately, the convolutional neural network can be used
to extract the visual features precisely. Therefore, the end-to-end neural
image caption (NIC) model can be utilized to obtain the textual information
describing the visual features of movie trailers. This paper proposes a trailer
inception probabilistic matrix factorization model called Ti-PMF, which
combines NIC, recurrent convolutional neural network, and probabilistic matrix
factorization models as the rating prediction model. We implement the proposed
Ti-PMF model with extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to
validate its effectiveness. The experimental results illustrate that the
proposed Ti-PMF outperforms the existing ones.

Previous work has shown that the use of Recurrent Neural Networks is promising
for the next-in-session prediction task, but has certain limitations when only
recorded item click sequences are used as input. In this work, we present a
contextual hybrid, deep learning based approach for session-based news
recommendation that is able to leverage a variety of information types. We
evaluated our approach on two public datasets, using a temporal evaluation
protocol that simulates the dynamics of a news portal in a realistic way. Our
results confirm the benefits of considering additional types of information,
including article popularity and recency, in the proposed way, resulting in
significantly higher recommendation accuracy and catalog coverage than other
session-based algorithms. Additional experiments show that the proposed
parameterizable loss function used in our method also allows us to balance two
usually conflicting quality factors, accuracy and novelty.

			<abs>  As a pivotal tool to alleviate the information overload problem, recommender
systems aim to predict user's preferred items from millions of candidates by
analyzing observed user-item relations. As for alleviating the sparsity and
cold start problems encountered by recommender systems, researchers resort to
employing side information or knowledge in recommendation as a strategy for
uncovering hidden (indirect) user-item relations, aiming to enrich observed
information (or data) for recommendation. However, in the face of the high
complexity and large scale of side information and knowledge, this strategy
relies for efficient implementation on the scalability of recommendation
models. Not until after the prevalence of machine learning did graph embedding
techniques be a concentration, which can efficiently utilize complex and
large-scale data. In light of that, equipping recommender systems with graph
embedding techniques has been widely studied these years, appearing to
outperform conventional recommendation implemented directly based on graph
topological analysis. As the focus, this article retrospects graph
embedding-based recommendation from embedding techniques for bipartite graphs,
general graphs and knowledge graphs, and proposes a general design pipeline of
that. In addition, after comparing several representative graph embedding-based
recommendation models with the most common-used conventional recommendation
models on simulations, this article manifests that the conventional models can
overall outperform the graph embedding-based ones in predicting implicit
user-item interactions, revealing the comparative weakness of graph
embedding-based recommendation in these tasks. To foster future research, this
article proposes suggestions on making a trade-off between graph
embedding-based recommendation and conventional recommendation in different

essential tools to help users find most relevant information. The most
heavily-used recommendation frameworks assume user interactions that are
characterized by a single relation. However, for many tasks, such as
recommendation in social networks, user-item interactions must be modeled as a
complex network of multiple relations, not only a single relation. Recently
research on multi-relational factorization and hybrid recommender models has
shown that using extended meta-paths to capture additional information about
both users and items in the network can enhance the accuracy of recommendations
in such networks. Most of this work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous
networks, and to apply these techniques, weighted relations must be simplified
into binary ones. However, information associated with weighted edges, such as
user ratings, which may be crucial for recommendation, are lost in such
binarization. In this paper, we explore a random walk sampling method in which
the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and apply this

unsolved problems and challenges that need to be further studied. To help
researchers master the advances in personalized news recommendation over the
past years, in this paper we present a comprehensive overview of personalized
news recommendation. Instead of following the conventional taxonomy of news
recommendation methods, in this paper we propose a novel perspective to
understand personalized news recommendation based on its core problems and the
associated techniques and challenges. We first review the techniques for
tackling each core problem in a personalized news recommender system and the
challenges they face. Next, we introduce the public datasets and evaluation
methods for personalized news recommendation. We then discuss the key points on
improving the responsibility of personalized news recommender systems. Finally,
we raise several research directions that are worth investigating in the
future. This paper can provide up-to-date and comprehensive views to help
readers understand the personalized news recommendation field. We hope this
paper can facilitate research on personalized news recommendation as well as
related fields in natural language processing and data mining.

			<abs>  Recommendation systems focus on helping users find items of interest in the
situations of information overload, where users' preferences are typically
estimated by the past observed behaviors. In contrast, conversational
recommendation systems (CRS) aim to understand users' preferences via
interactions in conversation flows. CRS is a complex problem that consists of
two main tasks: (1) recommendation and (2) response generation. Previous work
often tried to solve the problem in a modular manner, where recommenders and
response generators are separate neural models. Such modular architectures
often come with a complicated and unintuitive connection between the modules,
leading to inefficient learning and other issues. In this work, we propose a
unified framework based on BART for conversational recommendation, which
tackles two tasks in a single model. Furthermore, we also design and collect a
lightweight knowledge graph for CRS in the movie domain. The experimental
results show that the proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance
in terms of both automatic and human evaluation.

collaboration with other developers and awareness of artifacts such as work
items, pull requests, and files. With the speed of development increasing,
information overload is a challenge for people developing and maintaining these
systems. Finding information and people is difficult for software engineers,
especially when they work in large software systems or have just recently
joined a project. In this paper, we build a large scale data platform named
Nalanda platform, which contains two subsystems: 1. A large scale
socio-technical graph system, named Nalanda graph system 2. A large scale
recommendation system, named Nalanda index system that aims at satisfying the
information needs of software developers. The Nalanda graph is an enterprise
scale graph with data from 6,500 repositories, with 37,410,706 nodes and
128,745,590 edges. On top of the Nalanda graph system, we built software
analytics applications including a newsfeed named MyNalanda, and based on
organic growth alone, it has Daily Active Users (DAU) of 290 and Monthly Active
Users (MAU) of 590. A preliminary user study shows that 74% of developers and
engineering managers surveyed are favorable toward continued use of the
platform for information discovery. The Nalanda index system constitutes two
indices: artifact index and expert index. It uses the socio-technical graph
(Nalanda graph system) to rank the results and provide better recommendations
to software developers. A large scale quantitative evaluation shows that the
Nalanda index system provides recommendations with an accuracy of 78% for the
top three recommendations.

			<abs>  Recommender systems (RSs) have been a widely exploited approach to solving
the information overload problem. However, the performance is still limited due
to the extreme sparsity of the rating data. With the popularity of Web 2.0, the
social tagging system provides more external information to improve
recommendation accuracy. Although some existing approaches combine the matrix
factorization models with co-occurrence properties and context of tags, they
neglect the issue of tag sparsity without the commonly associated tags problem
that would also result in inaccurate recommendations. Consequently, in this
paper, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative filtering model named
WUDiff_RMF, which improves Regularized Matrix Factorization (RMF) model by
integrating Weighted User-Diffusion-based CF algorithm(WUDiff) that obtains the
information of similar users from the weighted tripartite user-item-tag graph.
This model aims to capture the degree correlation of the user-item-tag
tripartite network to enhance the performance of recommendation. Experiments
conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly performs better than already widely used methods in the accuracy
of recommendation. Moreover, results show that WUDiff_RMF can alleviate the
data sparsity, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings
and few tags.

users' burden on the information overload. In such a scenario, extensive amount
of heterogeneous information such as tags, image content, in addition to the
user-to-item preferences, is extremely valuable for making effective
recommendations. In this paper, we explore a novel hybrid algorithm termed {\em
STM}, for image recommendation. STM jointly considers the problem of image
content analysis with the users' preferences on the basis of sparse
representation. STM is able to tackle the challenges of highly sparse user
feedbacks and cold-start problmes in the social network scenario. In addition,
our model is based on the classical probabilistic matrix factorization and can
be easily extended to incorporate other useful information such as the social
relationships. We evaluate our approach with a newly collected 0.3 million
social image data set from Flickr. The experimental results demonstrate that
sparse topic modeling of the image content leads to more effective
recommendations, , with a significant performance gain over the

at approximately 3.5 percent per year for decades. This means that during a
typical 40 year career the amount of new literature produced each year
increases by a factor of four. The methods scholars use to discover relevant
literature must change. Just like everybody else involved in information
discovery, scholars are confronted with information overload. Two decades ago,
this discovery process essentially consisted of paging through abstract books,
talking to colleagues and librarians, and browsing journals. A time-consuming
process, which could even be longer if material had to be shipped from
elsewhere. Now much of this discovery process is mediated by online scholarly
information systems. All these systems are relatively new, and all are still
changing. They all share a common goal: to provide their users with access to
the literature relevant to their specific needs. To achieve this each system
responds to actions by the user by displaying articles which the system judges
relevant to the user's current needs. Recently search systems which use
particularly sophisticated methodologies to recommend a few specific papers to
the user have been called "recommender systems". These methods are in line with
the current use of the term "recommender system" in computer science. We do not
adopt this definition, rather we view systems like these as components in a
larger whole, which is presented by the scholarly information systems
themselves. In what follows we view the recommender system as an aspect of the
entire information system; one which combines the massive memory capacities of
the machine with the cognitive abilities of the human user to achieve a

most of them are based on similarities, such as collaborative filtering and

which combines advantages of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation

			<abs>  Recommender system has attracted lots of attentions since it helps users
alleviate the information overload problem. Matrix factorization technique is
one of the most widely employed collaborative filtering techniques in the
research of recommender systems due to its effectiveness and efficiency in
dealing with very large user-item rating matrices. Recently, based on the
intuition that additional information provides useful insights for matrix
factorization techniques, several recommendation algorithms have utilized
additional information to improve the performance of matrix factorization
methods. However, the majority focus on dealing with the cold start user
problem and ignore the cold start item problem. In addition, there are few
suitable similarity measures for these content enhanced matrix factorization
approaches to compute the similarity between categorical items. In this paper,
we propose attributes coupling based item enhanced matrix factorization method
by incorporating item attribute information into matrix factorization technique
as well as adapting the coupled object similarity to capture the relationship
between items. Item attribute information is formed as an item relationship
regularization term to regularize the process of matrix factorization.
Specifically, the similarity between items is measured by the Coupled Object
Similarity considering coupling between items. Experimental results on two real
data sets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
recommendation algorithms and can effectively cope with the cold start item
problem when more item attribute information is available.

			<abs>  There exist situations of decision-making under information overload in the
Internet, where people have an overwhelming number of available options to
choose from, e.g. products to buy in an e-commerce site, or restaurants to
visit in a large city. Recommender systems arose as a data-driven personalized
decision support tool to assist users in these situations: they are able to
process user-related data, filtering and recommending items based on the users
preferences, needs and/or behaviour. Unlike most conventional recommender
approaches where items are inanimate entities recommended to the users and
success is solely determined upon the end users reaction to the
recommendation(s) received, in a Reciprocal Recommender System (RRS) users
become the item being recommended to other users. Hence, both the end user and
the user being recommended should accept the 'matching' recommendation to yield
a successful RRS performance. The operation of an RRS entails not only
predicting accurate preference estimates upon user interaction data as
classical recommenders do, but also calculating mutual compatibility between
(pairs of) users, typically by applying fusion processes on unilateral
user-to-user preference information. This paper presents a snapshot-style
analysis of the extant literature that summarizes the state-of-the-art RRS
research to date, focusing on the algorithms, fusion processes and fundamental
characteristics of RRS, both inherited from conventional user-to-item
recommendation models and those inherent to this emerging family of approaches.
Representative RRS models are likewise highlighted. Following this, we discuss
the challenges and opportunities for future research on RRSs, with special
focus on (i) fusion strategies to account for reciprocity and (ii) emerging
application domains related to social recommendation.

paper, we investigate the effective data fusion by combining the two
approaches, in two steps. First, we extend Social MF to exploit the graph
structure of neighbors. Second, we propose a novel framework MR3 to jointly

aligning latent factors and hidden topics. We achieve more accurate rating
prediction on two real-life datasets. Furthermore, we measure the contribution

			<abs>  Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to
alleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a
user to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation
problem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to
recommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods
typically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,
and great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and
reinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational
complexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the
recommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster
head selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the
recommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender
System (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.
Furthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation
process, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also
introduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to
balance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new
metric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only
from an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.
With experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS
is effective and can outperform baseline methods.

			<abs>  Business success in e-commerce depends on customer perceived value. A
customer with high perceived value buys, returns, and recommends items. The
perceived value is at risk whenever the information load harms users' shopping
experience. In e-grocery, shoppers face an overwhelming number of items, the
majority of which is irrelevant for the shopper. Recommender systems (RS)
enable businesses to master information overload (IO) by providing users with
an item ranking by relevance. Prior work proposes RS with short personalized
rankings (top-k). Given large order sizes and high user heterogeneity in
e-grocery, top-k RS are insufficient to diminish IO in this domain. To fill
this gap and raise business performance, this paper introduces an RS with a
personalized long ranking (top-N). Undertaking a randomized field experiment,
the paper establishes the merit of shifting from top-k to top-N rankings.
Specifically, the proposed RS reduces IO by 29.4% and lowers users' search time
by 3.3 seconds per item. The field experiment also reveals a 7% uplift in
revenue due to the top-N ranking. Substantial benefits for the customer and the
company highlight the business value of top-N rankings as a new design
requirement for recommender systems in e-grocery.

overload. In recent years, we observed increased interest in session-based
recommendation scenarios, where the problem is to make item suggestions to
users based only on interactions observed in an ongoing session. However, in
cases where interactions from previous user sessions are available, the
recommendations can be personalized according to the users' long-term
preferences, a process called session-aware recommendation. Today, research in
this area is scattered and many existing works only compare session-aware with
session-based models. This makes it challenging to understand what represents
the state-of-the-art. To close this research gap, we benchmarked recent
session-aware algorithms against each other and against a number of
session-based recommendation algorithms and trivial extensions thereof. Our
comparison, to some surprise, revealed that (i) item simple techniques based on
nearest neighbors consistently outperform recent neural techniques and that
(ii) session-aware models were mostly not better than approaches that do not
use long-term preference information. Our work therefore not only points to
potential methodological issues where new methods are compared to weak
baselines, but also indicates that there remains a huge potential for more
sophisticated session-aware recommendation algorithms.

			<abs>  Recently, sequential recommendation systems are important in solving the
information overload in many online services. Current methods in sequential
recommendation focus on learning a fixed number of representations for each
user at any time, with a single representation or multi representations for the
user. However, when a user is exploring items on an e-commerce recommendation
system, the number of this user's hobbies may change overtime (e.g.
increase/reduce one more interest), affected by the user's evolving self needs.
Moreover, different users may have various number of interests. In this paper,
we argue that it is meaningful to explore a personalized dynamic number of user
interests, and learn a dynamic group of user interest representations
accordingly. We propose a sequential model with dynamic number of
representations for recommendation systems (RDRSR). Specifically, RDRSR is
composed of a dynamic interest discriminator (DID) module and a dynamic
interest allocator (DIA) module. The DID module explores the number of a user's

			<abs>  Recommender systems are software applications that help users to find items
of interest in situations of information overload. Current research often
assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users' preferences are
estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a
ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user
interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach
and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example,
help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask
questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS
has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly
due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the
emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of
chatbot technology. With this paper, we provide a detailed survey of existing
approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in
various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the
knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological
approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps
that deserve more research in the future.

			<abs>  Recently, recommender systems play a pivotal role in alleviating the problem
of information overload. Latent factor models have been widely used for
recommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the
interaction information between users and items, although some recently
extended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent
factor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the
characteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of
purchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of
items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and
category-aspect of items. Moreover, the latent factor models usually use the
shallow projection, which cannot capture the characteristics of users and items
well. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level
Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent
factors. Through modelling the rich object properties and relations in
recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first
extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items
respectively through different meta-paths, and then feeds an elaborately
designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent
factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent factors are fused for the top-N
recommendation. Moreover, to fuse information from different aspects more
effectively, we further propose NeuACF++ to fuse aspect-level latent factors
with self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three real world
datasets show that NeuACF and NeuACF++ significantly outperform both existing
latent factor models and recent neural network models.

			<abs>  To cope with the ever-growing information overload, an increasing number of
digital libraries employ content-based recommender systems. These systems
traditionally recommend related documents with the help of similarity measures.
However, current document similarity measures simply distinguish between
similar and dissimilar documents. This simplification is especially crucial for
extensive documents, which cover various facets of a topic and are often found
in digital libraries. Still, these similarity measures neglect to what facet
the similarity relates. Therefore, the context of the similarity remains
ill-defined. In this doctoral thesis, we explore contextual document similarity
measures, i.e., methods that determine document similarity as a triple of two
documents and the context of their similarity. The context is here a further
specification of the similarity. For example, in the scientific domain,
research papers can be similar with respect to their background, methodology,
or findings. The measurement of similarity in regards to one or more given
contexts will enhance recommender systems. Namely, users will be able to
explore document collections by formulating queries in terms of documents and
their contextual similarities. Thus, our research objective is the development
and evaluation of a recommender system based on contextual similarity. The
underlying techniques will apply established similarity measures and as well as
neural approaches while utilizing semantic features obtained from links between
documents and their text.

			<abs>  With the development of information technology and the Internet,
recommendation systems have become an important means to solve the problem of
information overload. However, recommendation system is greatly fragile as it
relies heavily on behavior data of users, which makes it very easy for a host
of malicious merchants to inject shilling attacks in order to manipulate the
recommendation results. Some papers on shilling attack have proposed the
detection methods, whether based on false user profiles or abnormal items, but
their detection rate, false alarm rate, universality, and time overhead need to
be further improved. In this paper, we propose a new item anomaly detection
method, through T-distribution technology based on Dynamic Time Intervals.
First of all, based on the characteristics of shilling attack quickness
(Attackers inject a large number of fake profiles in a short period in order to
save costs), we use dynamic time interval method to divide the rating history
of item into multiple time windows. Then, we use the T-distribution to detect
the exception windows. By conducting extensive experiments on a dataset that
accords with real-life situations and comparing it to currently outstanding
methods, our proposed approach has a higher detection rate, lower false alarm
rate and smaller time overhead to the different attack models and filler sizes.

			<abs>  Recommender systems (RSs) have emerged as very useful tools to help customers
with their decision-making process, find items of their interest, and alleviate
the information overload problem. There are two different lines of approaches
in RSs: (1) general recommenders with the main goal of discovering long-term
users' preferences, and (2) sequential recommenders with the main focus of
capturing short-term users' preferences in a session of user-item interaction
(here, a session refers to a record of purchasing multiple items in one
shopping event). While considering short-term users' preferences may satisfy
their current needs and interests, long-term users' preferences provide users
with the items that they may interact with, eventually. In this thesis, we
first focus on improving the performance of general RSs. Most of the existing
general RSs tend to exploit the users' rating patterns on common items to
detect similar users. The data sparsity problem (i.e. the lack of available
information) is one of the major challenges for the current general RSs, and
they may fail to have any recommendations when there are no common items of
interest among users. We call this problem data sparsity with no feedback on
common items (DSW-n-FCI). To overcome this problem, we propose a
personality-based RS in which similar users are identified based on the
similarity of their personality traits.

innovation. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which often prioritize
relevance, can further reinforce these informational "filter bubbles." In
response, we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars
and their work. We construct a faceted representation of authors with
information gleaned from their papers and inferred author personas, and use it
to develop an approach that locates commonalities and contrasts between
scientists to balance relevance and novelty. In studies with computer science
researchers, this approach helps users discover authors considered useful for
generating novel research directions. We also demonstrate an approach for

scholarly information wants to capture and keep the attention of its target

solution and argue that it is practically feasible to incorporate this approach

information overload that makes it difficult for them to find a suitable
content according to their personal preferences. Recommendation service is one
of the most widely adopted technologies for alleviating this problem, these
services intend to provide people with referrals of items they will appreciate
based on their preferences. IPTV users must ensure their sensitive preferences
collected by any recommendation service are properly secured. In this work, we
introduce a framework for private recommender service based on Enhanced
Middleware for Collaborative Privacy (EMCP). EMCP executes a two-stage
concealment process that gives the user a complete control on the privacy level
of his/her profile. We utilize trust mechanism to augment the accuracy and
privacy of the recommendations. Trust heuristic spot users who are trustworthy
with respect to the user requesting the recommendation. Later, the neighborhood
formation is calculated using proximity metrics based on these trustworthy
users. Finally, Users submit their profiles in an obfuscated form without
revealing any information about their data, and the computation of
recommendations proceeds over the obfuscated data using secure multiparty
computation protocol. We expand the obfuscation scope from single obfuscation
level for all users to arbitrary obfuscation levels based on trustworthy
between users. In other words, we correlate the obfuscation level with
different trust levels, so the more trusted a target user is the less
obfuscation copy of profile he can access. We also provide an IPTV network
scenario and experimentation results. Our results and analysis show that our
two-stage concealment process not only protects the privacy of users but also
can maintain the recommendations accuracy.

years, the class of session-based recommendation algorithms received more
attention in the research literature. These algorithms base their
recommendations solely on the observed interactions with the user in an ongoing
session and do not require the existence of long-term preference profiles. Most
recently, a number of deep learning based ("neural") approaches to
session-based recommendations were proposed. However, previous research
indicates that today's complex neural recommendation methods are not always
better than comparably simple algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.
  With this work, our goal is to shed light on the state-of-the-art in the area
of session-based recommendation and on the progress that is made with neural
approaches. For this purpose, we compare twelve algorithmic approaches, among
them six recent neural methods, under identical conditions on various datasets.
We find that the progress in terms of prediction accuracy that is achieved with
neural methods is still limited. In most cases, our experiments show that
simple heuristic methods based on nearest-neighbors schemes are preferable over
conceptually and computationally more complex methods. Observations from a user
study furthermore indicate that recommendations based on heuristic methods were
also well accepted by the study participants. To support future progress and
reproducibility in this area, we publicly share the session-rec evaluation

to enhance the interactivity between items in user's behavior sequence, which
can capture both global and local item features. Finally, a multi-interest

			<abs>  Recommender systems (RSs) provide an effective way of alleviating the

users. Latent factors based collaborative filtering (CF) has become the popular
approaches for RSs due to its accuracy and scalability. Recently, online social
networks and user-generated content provide diverse sources for recommendation
beyond ratings. Although {\em social matrix factorization} (Social MF) and {\em
topic matrix factorization} (Topic MF) successfully exploit social relations
and item reviews, respectively, both of them ignore some useful information. In
this paper, we investigate the effective data fusion by combining the
aforementioned approaches. First, we propose a novel model {\em \mbox{MR3}} to
jointly model three sources of information (i.e., ratings, item reviews, and
social relations) effectively for rating prediction by aligning the latent
factors and hidden topics. Second, we incorporate the implicit feedback from
ratings into the proposed model to enhance its capability and to demonstrate
its flexibility. We achieve more accurate rating prediction on real-life

amount of users' personal data collected from users' devices and then centrally

globe on user privacy leakage in the online platform, the public is becoming
anxious by such abuse of user privacy. Therefore, it is urgent and beneficial
to develop a recommender system that can achieve both high prediction accuracy

that a user's data never leaves his/her during the course of model training. On
the other hand, to better embrace the data heterogeneity commonly existing in

fast in-device personalization with only few data points. Furthermore, to
defense from potential malicious participant that poses serious security threat

validate the superiority of our proposed PrivRec and DP-PrivRec.

that are vital for developing effective personal mobile assistants: target apps
selection and recommendation. The former is the key component of a unified

all the apps installed on their devices with a unified mode of access. The
latter, instead, predicts the next apps that the users would want to launch.

thousands of mobile queries enriched with mobile sensor data (now publicly
available for research purposes). With the aid of this dataset, we study the
user behavior in the context of these tasks and propose a family of
context-aware neural models that take into account the sequential, temporal,

and matching user interests in various web-scale applications. Most RS retrieve
the user's favorite candidates and then rank them by the rating scores in the
greedy manner. In the permutation prospective, however, current RS come to
reveal the following two limitations: 1) They neglect addressing the
permutation-variant influence within the recommended results; 2) Permutation
consideration extends the latent solution space exponentially, and current RS
lack the ability to evaluate the permutations. Both drive RS away from the
permutation-optimal recommended results and better user experience. To
approximate the permutation-optimal recommended results effectively and
efficiently, we propose a novel permutation-wise framework PRS in the
re-ranking stage of RS, which consists of Permutation-Matching (PMatch) and
Permutation-Ranking (PRank) stages successively. Specifically, the PMatch stage
is designed to obtain the candidate list set, where we propose the FPSA
algorithm to generate multiple candidate lists via the permutation-wise and
goal-oriented beam search algorithm. Afterwards, for the candidate list set,
the PRank stage provides a unified permutation-wise ranking criterion named LR
metric, which is calculated by the rating scores of elaborately designed
permutation-wise model DPWN. Finally, the list with the highest LR score is
recommended to the user. Empirical results show that PRS consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PRS has achieved

However, the explosive growth of open source software packages exposes
developers to the challenge of information overload. While this can be
addressed by conventional recommender systems, they usually do not consider
particular constraints of social coding such as social influence among
developers and dependency relations among software packages. In this paper, we
aim to model the dynamic interests of developers with both social influence and
dependency constraints, and propose the Session-based Social and
Dependency-aware software Recommendation (SSDRec) model. This model integrates
recurrent neural network (RNN) and graph attention network (GAT) into a unified
framework. An RNN is employed to model the short-term dynamic interests of
developers in each session and two GATs are utilized to capture social
influence from friends and dependency constraints from dependent software
packages, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world
datasets and the results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms
the competitive baselines.

			<abs>  Recommender systems are software applications that help users find items of
interest in situations of information overload in a personalized way, using
knowledge about the needs and preferences of individual users. In
conversational recommendation approaches, these needs and preferences are
acquired by the system in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. A common approach
in the literature to drive such dialogs is to incrementally ask users about
their preferences regarding desired and undesired item features or regarding
individual items. A central research goal in this context is efficiency,
evaluated with respect to the number of required interactions until a
satisfying item is found. This is usually accomplished by making inferences
about the best next question to ask to the user. Today, research on dialog
efficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example,
that one strategy for selecting questions is better than another one in a given
application. With this work, we complement empirical research with a
theoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This
model, which is designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us
to investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way, in
particular with respect to the computational complexity of devising optimal
interaction strategies. Through such a theoretical analysis we show that
finding an efficient conversational strategy is NP-hard, and in PSPACE in
general, but for particular kinds of catalogs the upper bound lowers to
POLYLOGSPACE. From a practical point of view, this result implies that catalog
characteristics can strongly influence the efficiency of individual
conversational strategies and should therefore be considered when designing new
strategies. A preliminary empirical analysis on datasets derived from a
real-world one aligns with our findings.

			<abs>  Online forums enable users to discuss together around various topics. One of
the serious problems of these environments is high volume of discussions and
thus information overload problem. Unfortunately without considering the users
interests, traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques are not able to
solve the problem. Therefore, employment of a Recommender System (RS) that
could suggest favorite's topics of users according to their tastes could
increases the dynamism of forum and prevent the users from duplicate posts. In
addition, consideration of semantics can be useful for increasing the
performance of IR based RS. Our goal is study of impact of ontology and data
mining techniques on improving of content-based RS. For this purpose, at first,
three type of ontologies will be constructed from the domain corpus with
utilization of text mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Wordnet and
then they will be used as an input in two kind of RS: one, fully ontology-based
and one with enriching the user profile vector with ontology in vector space
model (VSM) (proposed method). Afterward the results will be compared with the
simple VSM based RS. Given results show that the proposed RS presents the
highest performance.

			<abs>  Recommender systems are designed to help mitigate information overload users
experience during online shopping. Recent work explores neural language models
to learn user and item representations from user reviews and combines such
representations with rating information. Most existing convolutional-based
neural models take pooling immediately after convolution and loses the
interaction information between the latent dimension of convolutional feature
vectors along the way. Moreover, these models usually take all feature vectors
at higher levels as equal and do not take into consideration that some features
are more relevant to this specific user-item context. To bridge these gaps,
this paper proposes a convolutional quantum-like language model with
mutual-attention for rating prediction (ConQAR). By introducing a quantum-like
density matrix layer, interactions between latent dimensions of convolutional
feature vectors are well captured. With the attention weights learned from the
mutual-attention layer, final representations of a user and an item absorb
information from both itself and its counterparts for making rating prediction.
Experiments on two large datasets show that our model outperforms multiple
state-of-the-art CNN-based models. We also perform an ablation test to analyze
the independent effects of the two components of our model. Moreover, we
conduct a case study and present visualizations of the quantum probabilistic
distributions in one user and one item review document to show that the learned
distributions capture meaningful information about this user and item, and can
be potentially used as textual profiling of the user and item.

			<abs>  Machine learning techniques for Recommendation System (RS) and Classification
has become a prime focus of research to tackle the problem of information
overload. RS are software tools that aim at making informed decisions about the
services that a user may like. On the other hand, classification technique
deals with the categorization of a data object into one of the several
predefined classes. In the multi-label classification problem, unlike the
traditional multi-class classification setting, each instance can be
simultaneously associated with a subset of labels. The focus of thesis is on
the development of novel techniques for collaborative filtering and multi-label
classification.
  We propose a novel method of constructing a hierarchical bi-level maximum
margin matrix factorization to handle matrix completion of ordinal rating
matrix. Taking the cue from the alternative formulation of support vector
machines, a novel loss function is derived by considering proximity as an
alternative criterion instead of margin maximization criterion for matrix
factorization framework.
  We extended the concept of matrix factorization for yet another important
problem of machine learning namely multi-label classification which deals with
the classification of data with multiple labels. We propose a novel
piecewise-linear embedding method with a low-rank constraint on parametrization
to capture nonlinear intrinsic relationships that exist in the original feature
and label space. We also study the embedding of labels together with the group
information with an objective to build an efficient multi-label classifier. We
assume the existence of a low-dimensional space onto which the feature vectors
and label vectors can be embedded. We ensure that labels belonging to the same
group share the same sparsity pattern in their low-rank representations.
