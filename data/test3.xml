			<abs>  Modern commercial organisations are facing pressures which have caused them
to lose personnel. When they lose people, they also lose their knowledge.
Organisations also have to cope with the internationalisation of business
forcing collaboration and knowledge sharing across time and distance. Knowledge
Management (KM) claims to tackle these issues. This paper looks at an area
where KM does not offer sufficient support, that is, the sharing of knowledge
that is not easy to articulate.
  The focus in this paper is on Communities of Practice in commercial
organisations. We do this by exploring knowledge sharing in Lave and Wenger's
[1] theory of Communities of Practice and investigating how Communities of
Practice may translate to a distributed international environment. The paper
reports on two case studies that explore the functioning of Communities of
Practice across international boundaries.

			<abs>  Collaboration technology typically focuses on collaboration and group
processes (cooperation, communication, coordination and coproduction).
Knowledge Management (KM) technology typically focuses on content (creation,
storage, sharing and use of data, information and knowledge). Yet, to achieve
their common goals, teams and organizations need both KM and collaboration
technology to make that more effective and efficient. This paper is interested
in knowledge management and collaboration regarding their convergence and their
integration. First, it contributes to a better understanding of the knowledge
management and collaboration concepts. Second, it focuses on KM and
collaboration convergence by presenting the different interpretation of this
convergence. Third, this paper proposes a generic framework of collaborative
knowledge management.

			<abs>  Increased usage of the internet has contributed immensely to the growth of
software development practice in East Africa. This paper investigates the
existence of formal KM (Knowledge Management) initiatives in the Software
industry such as creation of virtual communities (Communities of practice and
communities of interest); expert localization and establishment of knowledge
taxonomies in these communities; the knowledge transfer and sharing processes;
incubation and Mentorship; collaborative software development and their role in
creating entrepreneurship initiatives and providing a building block towards
the knowledge economies. We propose a hybrid framework for use in KM initiative

			<abs>  In this digital age organizations depend upon the technologies to provide
customer-centric solutions by understanding well about their customers'
behaviour and continuously improving business process of the organization.
Business intelligence (BI) applications will play a vital role at this stage by
discovering the knowledge hidden in internal as well as external sources. On
the other hand, Knowledge Management (KM) will enhance the organisations
performance by providing collaborative tools to learn, create and share the
knowledge among the employees. The main intention of the BI is to enhance the
employees' knowledge with information that allows them to make decisions to
achieve its organisational strategies. However only twenty percent of data
exist in structured form, majority of banks knowledge is in unstructured or
minds of its employees. Organizations are needed to integrate KM with Knowledge
which is discovered from data and information. The purpose of this paper is to
discuss the need of business insiders in the process of knowledge discovery and
distribution, to make BI more relevant to business of the bank. We have also
discussed about the BI/KM applications in banking industry and provided a
framework to integrate BI and KM in banking industry.

			<abs>  Knowledge-intensive companies that adopt Agile Software Development (ASD)
relay on efficient implementation of Knowledge Management (KM) strategies to
promotes different Knowledge Processes (KPs) to gain competitive advantage.
This study aims to explore how companies that adopt ASD implement KM strategies
utilizing practices that promote the KPs in the different organizational
layers. Through a systematic literature review, we analyzed 32 primary studies,
selected by automated search and snowballing in the extant literature. To
analyze the data, we applied narrative synthesis. Most of the identified KM
practices implement personalization strategies (81 %), supported by
codification (19 %). Our review shows that the primary studies do not report KM
practices in the strategic layer and two of them in the product portfolio
layer; on the other hand, in the project layer, the studies report 33 practices
that implement personalization strategy, and seven practices that implement
codification. KM strategies in ASD promote mainly the knowledge transfer
process with practices that stimulate social interaction to share tacit
knowledge in the project layer. As a result of using informal communication, a
significant amount of knowledge can be lost or not properly transferred to
other individuals and, instead of propagating the knowledge, it remains inside
a few individuals minds.

			<title>Strategies for fostering Knowledge Management Programs in Public

			<abs>  Knowledge Management (KM) is an approach to achieving strategic objectives by
visualizing, sharing, and using intangible resources of an organization and its
stakeholders. There are many studies that analyze specific factors for the
successful implementation of KM programs, and the evaluation of such factors is
considered a strategic tool for Public Organizations (POs) for efficiently
directing the implementation of a KM program. Nevertheless, there are cultural
problems such as weak trust, bad collaboration; technological problems as KM
systems difficult to use, nor interconnected or interoperable; and strategic
problems as political changes, not inter-administration continuity or lack of
political willingness. In this research we provide an overview of the key
factors for facilitating the implementation of KM programs. To this end, we
conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of success factors to create a
KM program for POs. Analyzing the twenty related studies we summarize benefits
and quality attributes of KM. Moreover, we obtained from an ongoing project
evaluation results of the KM factors ranked cultural, technological and
strategic. The results show that the Mexican POs have strategic and
technological issues such as: a misalignment between knowledge management and
organizational goals, it seems that POs are barely reusing their knowledge to
execute their daily activities or to take decisions, and is not possible to
know who and how a knowledge asset has been used. Finally, according to the
gaps and difficulties of the SLR, we provide strategies to successfully
implement KM programs in Mexico.

			<abs>  Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better
the needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the
specific case of project management training. The results of a course
observation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools
involves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore
dissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of
knowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a
personalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or
tutor), which gives information to monitor activities and supports the
acquisition and transfer of expertise. This platform is based on Knowledge
Management (KM) and Web 2.0 concepts to support the dynamic building of
knowledge. KM is used to define the learning process (based on the experiential
learning theory) and the way the individual knowledge building is monitored
(based on metacognitive concepts). Web 2.0 is used to define the way the
experience is shared. We make the hypothesis that this approach improves the
acquisition of complex skills (e.g. management, communication and
collaboration), which requires a behavioural evolution. We aim at making the
students become able 'to learn to learn' and evolve according to contexts. We
facilitate their ability to have a critical analysis of their actions according
to the situations they encounter.

			<abs>  We consider the possibility that the Galactic neutral hydrogen stream Complex
A and the stellar Orphan stream are related, and use this hypothesis to
determine possible distances to Complex A and the Orphan stream, and
line-of-sight velocities for the latter. The method presented uses our current
knowledge of the projected positions of the streams, as well as line-of-sight
velocities for Complex A, and we show that a solution exists in which the two
streams share the same orbit. If Complex A and the Orphan stream are on this
orbit, our calculations suggest the Orphan stream to be at an average distance
of 20 kpc, with heliocentric radial velocities of approximately -110 km/s.
Complex A would be ahead of the Orphan stream in the same wrap of the orbit,
with an average distance of 10 kpc, which is consistent with the distance
constraints determined through interstellar absorption line techniques.

			<abs>  Two-thirds of the people who buy a new car prefer to use a substitute instead
of the built-in navigation system. However, for many applications, knowledge
about a user's intended destination and route is crucial. For example,
suggestions for available parking spots close to the destination can be made or
ride-sharing opportunities along the route are facilitated. Our approach
predicts probable destinations and routes of a vehicle, based on the most
recent partial trajectory and additional contextual data. The approach follows
a three-step procedure: First, a $k$-d tree-based space discretization is
performed, mapping GPS locations to discrete regions. Secondly, a recurrent
neural network is trained to predict the destination based on partial sequences
of trajectories. The neural network produces destination scores, signifying the
probability of each region being the destination. Finally, the routes to the
most probable destinations are calculated. To evaluate the method, we compare
multiple neural architectures and present the experimental results of the
destination prediction. The experiments are based on two public datasets of
non-personalized, timestamped GPS locations of taxi trips. The best performing
models were able to predict the destination of a vehicle with a mean error of
1.3 km and 1.43 km respectively.

			<abs>  Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic
core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm
becomes compromised. Conversely, versatile cryptography allows the user to
switch the cryptographic task without requiring any knowledge of its inner
workings. In this paper, we suggest how these related principles can be applied
to the field of quantum cryptography by explicitly demonstrating two quantum
cryptographic protocols, quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret
sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform. Crucially,
the protocols differ only in their classical post-processing. The system is
also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with
deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature
phase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first
time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver,
enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are
inherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a
player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external)
eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In our first
proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile and versatile quantum
communication system, the quantum states were distributed at GHz rates. This
allows for a one-bit message to be securely signed using our QDS protocols in
less than $0.05$~ms over a $2$~km fiber link and in less than $0.2$~s over a
$20$~km fiber link. To our knowledge, this also marks the first demonstration
of a continuous-variable direct QSS protocol.
